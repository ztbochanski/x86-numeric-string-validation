# x86-numeric-string-validation

> MACRO exploration
## Description

This program explores the use of macros by reading a user entered string, the string is validated by converting it to numerical values and throws an exception if the values are incorrect according to the requirements. (The focus of this assignment is employing the use of MACROS, further refining assembly skills, and on using STOSB/LODSB etc.) 

The flow of this program, based on the requirements, is as follows:

1. Get string input
2. Convert to integer
3. Store in array
4. Convert to hex string
5. Display

To summarize, this program reads an writes strings to the console however, it stores and manipulates the actual numerical value.
